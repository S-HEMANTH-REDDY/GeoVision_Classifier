# GeoVision_Classifier
GeoVision Classifier is an advanced image classification project adept at identifying geographical locations through state-of-the-art machine learning models. Trained on the Intel Image Classification dataset, comprising 25,000 images across six categories, the system excels in recognizing scenes such as buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets. The project features a user-friendly Streamlit interface, allowing seamless input of image URLs for prompt location predictions. Powered by a TensorFlow model, the application embraces MLops practices, incorporating Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring scalability and reliability. The Google Cloud Build integration automates the build and deployment process, emphasizing efficiency in deployment and orchestration workflows.
